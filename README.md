# libft
I recoded a few of the Libc functions and added additional ones to my library. This is project is part of the 42 program.
The goal of this project is not to implement the build in system functions as well as possible, but to get an understanding on the specific usecases of each function. After this project one should feel more confident with the libc functions.

## List of implemented functions
Too lazy to list all of them (too many)
